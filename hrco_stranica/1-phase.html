                  At Limitless Funding, you can get funded by reaching a profit target in the evaluation phase. For
                  example: If you sign up for a 25k 1-Phase challenge, your profit target will be 10%. Similarly, if you
                  sign up for a 25k 2-Step challenge, your profit target for Phase 1 will be 10%. After achieving the
                  profit target(s), you will be able to start trading with the live account funded with the real

                  In both the 2-Phase and 1-Phase evaluations, there is no requirement for a minimum number of trading
                  days. This implies that it is possible to achieve the profit target and become funded within 24 hours.
                  With the Withdraw On Demand feature, you have the flexibility to withdraw your initial payout whenever
                  you prefer. This means that you can begin the evaluation process and receive your first payout, all
                  within a 48-hour timeframe.

                <p>
                  Daily loss limit specifies that you are permitted to lose 5% on 1-Phase and 4% on the 2-Phase of your
                  initial account balance on any given day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So here is how the calculation works for 1-Phase evaluation accounts:
                </p>

                <p>
                  Your daily loss limit = Cumulative PnL of your open and close positions for the day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This implies that on that specific day, this number should not exceed 5% of your initial account
                  balance.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For example, if you have a $10,000 account, the maximum daily loss limit is $500, so you are not
                  allowed to lose more than $500 on any given day. Suppose you have lost a total of $300 in your closed
                  trades. In such a case, you cannot lose more than $200, including floating losses. Note that swap and
                  commission rates are included in this calculation. If you lose more than $200, it will be considered a
                  hard breach.
                </p>


                <p>
                  Similarly, let's say you gained $500 in profit in a single day. In such a case, you will be allowed to
                  lose $500 (your profit) + $500 (your daily loss limit) = $1000. Losing more than $1000 (in both open
                  and closed positions) will be considered a hard breach.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Let's look at another case. Assume, like in the previous scenario, that you lost $300 in a single day.
                  Then you take a trade that is now running at a floating loss of -$250, but when you close it, it
                  becomes positive $50. If this occurs, according to our calculations, you will have exceeded your daily
                  loss limit the instant your loss exceeds $500.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another thing to keep in mind is that your daily loss limit will be reset at 5PM EST. As an example,
                  suppose you have gained a $200 profit in a closed trade and you have a trade that is currently running
                  in -$600 floating loss. In this case, you still have not violated your daily drawdown for the day
                  because your current daily loss is +$200 - $600= -$400. However, if you hold this one trade with a
                  floating loss of $600 after 5PM EST, you will breach the daily loss limit because a new day begins
                  after 5PM EST and you have already lost $600, which is more than your daily loss limit of $500.

                </p>

                <p>
                  You are allowed to have an overall maximum loss limit of 8% on 2-Phase and 6% on 1-Phase of your
                  initial account balance. Same drawdown limits apply on both evaluation and live funded accounts.

                <p>
                  On a live funded account, when you reach either a 8% profit on a 2-Phase or a 6% profit on a 1-phase
                  account, your maximum overall drawdown will be set on your starting balance. So, if you reach a profit
                  of 15%, your maximum overall loss will be set at your starting balance, and will not trail. Meaning
                  you can lose 14.99% without hard breaching your account. See FAQ for more details.

                  The Maximum Drawdown is the combination of trailing and static drawdown in order to provide traders
                  with the maximum flexibility to freely compound their accounts . When your account is first opened,
                  your Maximum Trailing Drawdown is set at 6% (or 8% for 2-Phase evaluation) of your initial balance.
                  This 6% (or 8%) drawdown trails your High Water Mark, which is the highest peak in value that your
                  account has reached, until your account achieves a 6% or 8% profit. After your account has gained a 6%
                  (or 8%) profit, the Maximum Trailing Drawdown becomes static and no longer trails, which means it
                  locks at your initial balance and no longer follows the fluctuations of your account. See FAQ for more

                  The leverage can be doubled with the add-on, in 2-Phase accounts leverage can go up to 30:1 and in

                  We do not offer excessive leverage for now as this can cause traders to blow their accounts.
                  The leverage we provide may be increased in the upcoming V2.0.

                  However spreads may widen during these periods. We advise to manage your positions and risk during

                  If you do not choose an add-on, we require all trades to be closed by 3:45pm EST on Friday. Any trades
                  left open after this time will automatically be closed. Note, this is only a soft breach and you will
                  be able to continue trading once the markets reopen.

                  The fee essentially acts as a demonstration of a trader's commitment to manage the account with utmost
                  care and responsibility. When a trader has something at stake, their trading psychology is more
                  engaged. Moreover, the fee is a minimal percentage compared to the size of the Limitless Funding
                  Account you'll receive after successfully completing the evaluation process.

                  The silver lining is that you cannot lose more than the fee as any potential losses on the Limitless
                  Funding Account are covered by us.
