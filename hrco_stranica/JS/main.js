        Daily loss limit specifies that you are permitted to lose 5% on 1-Phase and 4% on the 2-Phase of your
        initial account balance on any given day.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here is how the calculation works for 1-Phase evaluation accounts:
      </p>
      <p>
        Your daily loss limit = Cumulative PnL of your open and close positions for the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        This implies that on that specific day, this number should not exceed 5% of your initial account
        balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if you have a $10,000 account, the maximum daily loss limit is $500, so you are not allowed
        to lose more than $500 on any given day. Suppose you have lost a total of $300 in your closed trades. In
        such a case, you cannot lose more than $200, including floating losses. Note that swap and commission
        rates are included in this calculation. If you lose more than $200, it will be considered a hard breach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, let's say you gained $500 in profit in a single day. In such a case, you will be allowed to
        lose $500 (your profit) + $500 (your daily loss limit) = $1000. Losing more than $1000 (in both open and
        closed positions) will be considered a hard breach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's look at another case. Assume, like in the previous scenario, that you lost $300 in a single day.
        Then you take a trade that is now running at a floating loss of -$250, but when you close it, it becomes
        positive $50. If this occurs, according to our calculations, you will have exceeded your daily loss
        limit the instant your loss exceeds $500.
      </p>


      <p>
        Another thing to keep in mind is that your daily loss limit will be reset at 5PM EST. As an example,
        suppose you have gained a $200 profit in a closed trade and you have a trade that is currently running
        in -$600 floating loss. In this case, you still have not violated your daily drawdown for the day
        because your current daily loss is +$200 - $600= -$400. However, if you hold this one trade with a
        floating loss of $600 after 5PM EST, you will breach the daily loss limit because a new day begins after
        5PM EST and you have already lost $600, which is more than your daily loss limit of $500.

        The Maximum Overall Loss or The Maximum Drawdown refers to the highest amount your account can decrease
        in value before a hard breach of your account occurs.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are allowed to have an overall maximum loss limit of 8% on 2-Phase and 6% on 1-Phase of your initial
        account balance. Same drawdown limits apply on both evaluation and live funded accounts.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a live funded account, when you reach either a 8% profit on a 2-Phase or a 6% profit on a 1-phase
        account, your maximum overall drawdown will be set on your starting balance. So, if you reach a profit
        of 15%, your maximum overall loss will be set at your starting balance, and will not trail. Meaning you
        can lose 14.99% without hard breaching your account. See FAQ for more details.

        If you violate any rule, your account will be suspended. But you will receive the opportunity to

        fee since you will restart your trading cycle. This option is always applicable, whether you are in
        evaluation or the funded stage you will always have the option to try again at the discounted fee. The

        Daily loss limit specifies that you are permitted to lose 5% on 1-Phase and 4% on the 2-Phase of your
        initial account balance on any given day.
      </p>

      <p>
        So here is how the calculation works for 1-Phase evaluation accounts:

        balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if you have a $10,000 account, the maximum daily loss limit is $500, so you are not
        allowed to lose more than $500 on any given day. Suppose you have lost a total of $300 in your closed
        trades. In such a case, you cannot lose more than $200, including floating losses. Note that swap and
        commission rates are included in this calculation. If you lose more than $200, it will be considered a
        hard breach.
      </p>


      <p>
        Similarly, let's say you gained $500 in profit in a single day. In such a case, you will be allowed to
        lose $500 (your profit) + $500 (your daily loss limit) = $1000. Losing more than $1000 (in both open
        and closed positions) will be considered a hard breach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's look at another case. Assume, like in the previous scenario, that you lost $300 in a single day.
        Then you take a trade that is now running at a floating loss of -$250, but when you close it, it
        becomes positive $50. If this occurs, according to our calculations, you will have exceeded your daily
        loss limit the instant your loss exceeds $500.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another thing to keep in mind is that your daily loss limit will be reset at 5PM EST. As an example,
        suppose you have gained a $200 profit in a closed trade and you have a trade that is currently running
        in -$600 floating loss. In this case, you still have not violated your daily drawdown for the day
        because your current daily loss is +$200 - $600= -$400. However, if you hold this one trade with a
        floating loss of $600 after 5PM EST, you will breach the daily loss limit because a new day begins
        after 5PM EST and you have already lost $600, which is more than your daily loss limit of $500.

        Daily loss limit specifies that you are permitted to lose 5% on 1-Phase and 4% on the 2-Phase of your
        initial account balance on any given day.
      </p>

      <p>
        So here is how the calculation works for 1-Phase evaluation accounts:
      </p>

      <p>
        Your daily loss limit = Cumulative PnL of your open and close positions for the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        This implies that on that specific day, this number should not exceed 5% of your initial account
        balance.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if you have a $10,000 account, the maximum daily loss limit is $500, so you are not
        allowed to lose more than $500 on any given day. Suppose you have lost a total of $300 in your closed
        trades. In such a case, you cannot lose more than $200, including floating losses. Note that swap and
        commission rates are included in this calculation. If you lose more than $200, it will be considered a
        hard breach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, let's say you gained $500 in profit in a single day. In such a case, you will be allowed to
        lose $500 (your profit) + $500 (your daily loss limit) = $1000. Losing more than $1000 (in both open
        and closed positions) will be considered a hard breach.

      </p>
